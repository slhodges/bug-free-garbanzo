            <p><em>CHALLENGES:</em> The number of participating producers has doubled since the Passport's inception, from approximately 25 producers to 52 producers with 61 locations. Budget and production factors limited the page count, and the client wanted to stick to a pocket-sized "passport" format. Prizes awarded at various progress points throughout the Passport require a solution for redemption that does not require entire Passport to be submitted.</p>
              <p><em>SOLUTION:</em> All producers were allotted a half page listing in the Passport. They were given a recommended character limit for their location description; priority was given in each listing to pertinent information such as address, website and phone. Quick reference icons indicating specific features or offerings, and numeric icons for each producer match their marked location(s) on the custom Trail map at the front of the book. Tear-out pages in the back of the book allowed customers to redeem their stamps for prizes throughout the trail, while keeping the main body of the book as a souvenir of their journey if they wished.</p>

          <p><em>CHALLENGES:</em>The pandemic has been a difficult time for many, so everything needed to be presented tactfully and not overly self-aggrandizing. Needed to avoid representing the Bank as a savior of the community. Due to safety concerns, photo shoots for this year's report were short and participants were socially-distanced, and resultant photos reflected this.</p><p><em>SOLUTION:</em>Cover illustration is a play on the Bank's logo (a mountain silhouette in front of a rising sun) that features a number of people all working together to ascend, as a representation of the Bank's role in working together with the community to get through this challenging time. The group is nearing the lower of two peaks, to symbolize that the challenge is not over. The yellow sun graphic is carried through the report, to symbolize hope and optimism for the future. Client stories featured tightly-cropped, full spread photos to create a more dramatic, dynamic feel and to draw readers in.</p>

        <p><em>CHALLENGES:</em>Previous years' mailers have brought in fewer donations than expected. All were designed with fun, food-themed messages, but failed to bring in donations from a house list of previous donors. Client loves the food theme!</p><p><em>SOLUTION:</em>Format was switched from a card in an envelope (which communicates nothing if it doesn't get opened) to a 6x11 postcard. The messaging was switched up to emphasize the exponential value of a donation to this particular campaign (a fact that was mentioned as an aside previously) to drive home that even a small donation would be impactful. Client reported that they did see an increase in donations this year and were thrilled with the results.</p>
